    <a href="http://evt.labcd.unipi.it/" target="_blank">EVT (Edition Visualization Technology)</a> is a light-weight,
    open source tool specifically designed to create digital editions from texts encoded according to the
    <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/" target="_blank"> TEI XML schemas and Guidelines</a>, freeing the
    scholars from the burden of web programming and enabling the final users to browse, explore and study digital
    editions by means of a user-friendly interface.
  </p>
  <p>
    This tool was born in the context of the
    <a href="http://vbd.humnet.unipi.it/" target="_blank">Digital Vercelli Book</a> project, in order to allow the
    creation of a digital edition (which has been available in beta form for more than two years) of the Vercelli Book,
    a parchment codex of the late tenth century, now preserved in the Archivio e Biblioteca Capitolare of Vercelli and
    regarded as one of the four most important manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon period. However it has evolved into a tool
    suitable to fit different texts and needs. For example, it is now being used to publish the digital edition of the
    <a href="http://pelavicino.labcd.unipi.it" target="_blank">Codice Pelavicino manuscript</a>, a medieval codex
    preserving charters dating back to the XIII century.
  </p>
  <p>
    To ensure that it will be working on all the most recent web browsers, and for as long as possible on the World Wide
    Web itself, EVT is built on open and standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The entire
    structure of the software has been remodeled, in order to make it lighter, more usable and more adaptable; we
    decided to use the Model View Controller (MVC) approach to separate the logical presentation of the data, from the
    application logic and the processing core. Wanting to maintain the original feature of EVT, and therefore do not
    give up the client only approach, we decided to use <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a>, a
    JavaScript framework inspired by the MVC programming logic, especially suitable for the development of client-side
    Web applications.
